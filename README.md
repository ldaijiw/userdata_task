# User data task

You can assign user input to variables using input(), with a question in the form of a string to ask the user for their data. e.g

```
name = input("What's your name?)
```

Repeat for each piece of data:
- first name
- middle name
- last name
- address
- postcode
- NI number
- Course applied
- Most recent education

You can then print the desired data with an f-string
```
print(f"Hello, {first_name})
```
